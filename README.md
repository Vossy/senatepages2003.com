In 2003, I was a Page in the United States Senate. At the end of our tour of duty, my 29 classmates and I wanted a way to stay in touch, and Facebook didn't exist yet, so I developed this: my first-ever interactive web app.

This represents some of the oldest code I've ever written and still have access to. The code is embarrassingly bad, but keep in mind I was 17 years old and teaching myself PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript all at the same time. I didn't even know about source control(!), so unfortunately there's no commit history.

I don't expect to ever update this code, but I'm posting it publicly so we can all have a laugh at my crusty old PHP, and also as a reminder that everyone has to start somewhere.
